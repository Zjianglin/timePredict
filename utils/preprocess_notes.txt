1. Mostly, a one-to-many relationship was found between activity codes and labels.
The loss of information by replacing the codes with labels is secondary to the gains
in terms of interpretability. Consequently, the new activity identification
codes consist of the label of the activity and the name of the subprocess
(included in the original activity codes). The addition of the subprocess name
 connects the labels with the subprocesses to which they are related.
 For example: ‘01_HOOFD_010’ became ‘HOOFD register submission date request’.

 2. <date />string attribute values are stored as xs:dateTime data type.
 Times are expressed in local time, together with a time zone offset in hours and minutes.
 A time zone offset of "+hh:mm" indicates that the date/time uses a local time zone
 which is "hh" hours and "mm" minutes ahead of UTC. A time zone offset of "-hh:mm"
 indicates that the date/time uses a local time zone which is "hh" hours and "mm"
 minutes behind UTC

 3. <date />  translated to floating(days) using matplotlib.dates.datestr2num
